# User Guide: Interactive Controls

This document explains how to control the Conway's Game of Life simulation while it is running. The application accepts keyboard inputs to manage its state.

## Keyboard Commands

The simulation can be controlled with the following keys:

| Key         | Action                                   | Description                                                                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spacebar`  | **Toggle Play/Pause**                    | Toggles the simulation between the "playing" and "paused" states. The application starts in the "playing" state. |
| `q`         | **Quit**                                 | Gracefully stops the simulation and exits the application, returning you to the terminal prompt.          |

Here's the APL Game of Life expression broken down in three levels:

## Easy Version (What it does)
This code takes a grid of cells that are either alive or dead, and figures out what the grid should look like in the next moment. It follows the rules of Conway's Game of Life: cells live, die, or are born based on how many neighbors they have.

## Moderate Version (How it works)
The code creates 9 copies of the grid - the original plus 8 shifted versions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). It adds up all these shifted grids to count how many neighbors each cell has. Then it checks if each position has exactly 3 or 4 neighbors total (including itself). Finally, it combines this neighbor information with the original grid using Game of Life rules to determine which cells should be alive in the next generation.

## Hard Version (Symbol by symbol)
Reading right to left (APL evaluation order):
- `⊂⍵` - enclose the input grid
- `¯1 0 1∘.⌽` - create 3 versions shifted left, center, right  
- `¯1 0 1∘.⊖` - create 3 versions of each shifted up, center, down (9 total grids)
- `,` - flatten each grid into a vector
- `+/` - sum across all 9 vectors (counting neighbors + self)
- `3 4=` - create boolean mask where counts equal 3 or 4
- `⍵∨.∧` - combine original grid with neighbor mask using OR-AND logic (birth/survival rules)
- `↑1` - format result back into proper matrix shape

The genius is that checking for counts of 3 OR 4 automatically handles both rules: dead cells with 3 neighbors are born, live cells with 3 or 4 total (2 or 3 neighbors + themselves) survive.
